# Starfield-WeaponFoV-CheatEngine

**This is for people who want a different World and Viewmodel FoV.**

At the moment Starfield generates its Viewmodel FoV based on the setted up World FoV as soon as you talk to an NPC and start a dialog.

For 21:9 or 32:9 users however, a higher Viewmodel FoV is needed in comparison to the world FoV to achieve the same sort of weapon visibility like when playing with 16:9.
Also some people might want to have a higher Viewmodel value in general without touching the World FoV at all.

*As of now, there is no direct console command or ini setting available to set up the Viewmodel FoV.*
